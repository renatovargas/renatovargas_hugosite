abstract: "This pioneering work conducted in 2007 created a pilot environmental and economic 
           account for Lake Atitlán. Many of the lessons learned in the creation of this account
           would have an impact in the whole system of environmental accounts of Guatemala years 
           later."

## Summary

This was the first professional research project I was involved with. It was financed by the Dutch international cooperation agency Nuffic and executed by a consortium of three Dutch universities (Wageningen, Tilburg, and Utrecht) and two Guatemalan universities (Universidad Rafael Landívar and Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala). This study was carried out under a project to build analytical capabilities among Guatemalan researcher in environmental economics topics. 

We were able to estimate erosion, nitrogen and phosphorous per unit of output of coffee, maize, beans, fuelwood, as well as water use by hotels, households and waterborne illnesses in a single coherent system useful for comprehensive policy-making.

# Services performed

* Served as research liaison for environmental economics project funded by the Dutch Embassy to develop a pilot environmental accounts system for the Atitlán watershed in Guatemala.
* Implemented the then incipient environmental and economic accounts methodology. 
* Worked with municipal governments and local branches of the Ministry of Health to obtain data.
