As a young Economics student in Guatemala City in 2005, I was hired to conduct field research for a Dutch Government-financed project to build a pilot implementation of Natural Capital Accounts for Lake Atitlan's watershed. This was back when Natural Capital Accounting was in its infancy. Well, not really its infancy, it's more accurate to say it was in its teen years. I had the honor of working with Jan van Tongeren who had been at the head of the United Nations Statistics Division for some time and had retired into the consultant life at seventy-something. If you dig deep into the history of Natural Capital Accounting, he was right there at the birth of it with Peter Bartelmus and Carsten Stahmer when the first ideas for a System of National Accounts Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting Satellite Framework were put into paper. The paper was:

Bartelmus, P., Stahmer, C. and Tongeren, J.v. (1991), **Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting: Framework for a SNA Satellite System.** _Review of Income and Wealth_, 37: 111-148. [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4991.1991.tb00350.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4991.1991.tb00350.x)

Over decades, Environmental and Economic Accounting became a standard in its own right, and now it's at the helm of the new economy agenda. Sadly, we never wrote a paper on Atitlan, which I now regret, but the experience opened my eyes to a number of things that would come to define my life after that. The first was learning about The Netherlands; a beautiful country that would become my home during my Master's studies some five years later, when I studied International Economics and Business at the University of Groningen under an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. There I had the honor of having [my thesis on the links between Economics and Human Health](https://feb.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/id/eprint/8569) supervised by the President of the International Input-Output Association, Erik Dietzenbacher.

Another thing that I learned at the time is that there was a job description that had fallen through the cracks of productive society in which people get paid to think, play with the computer, and write. It was perfect, I had always wanted to write for a living as a foreign correspondent and independent research had a lot of the elements of that, _sans_ the life risking.

It also taught me that economics could mean much more than senseless growth. Natural capital accounting has allowed me to work in the economic profession and still care about the environment and human health. And that is what I have been doing for the past decade and a half. I started out putting together environmental and economic accounting for energy in Guatemala.

I have worked on environmental and economic accounting in Kyrgyzstan, Fiji, Egypt, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Colombia, and many other countries with Onil Banerjee of the Inter-American Bank and Juan Pablo Castaneda of The World Bank. My intellectual and professional interests revolve around Wealth, Environmentally-Extended Input-output Modeling, Computable General Equilibrium Modeling, Ecosystem Service Modeling, GIS, statistical programming, data visualization, and scientific writing.
